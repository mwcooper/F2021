    "The first step of designing the LQR controller for our quadrotor is to linearize the system about the hover state. The equations for the 3D quadrotor, however, are complicated, and computing the necessary derivatives is too tedious to want to do by hand. Therefore, we will use a computer algebra system (CAS) to save us a lot of time in computing derivatives. Specifically, we will be using the [SymPy](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) package to help us along the way. If you have experience with Mathematica or MATLAB's Symbolic Toolkit, SymPy offers many of the same features but in a Python interface, and even allows us to convert the symbolic functions that we will derive into efficient numerical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will demonstrate how to use SymPy to symbolically linearize the planar quadrotor model, then leave it to you to linearize the 3D model. We also suggest looking through the [brief tutorial](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html) given in the SymPy documentation, which will cover most of what you will need for this assignment. Again, the dynamics of the planar quadrotor are:\n",

    "# Part II: Calculating Thrust Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, we will calculate the _thrust coefficient_ and _drag coefficient_ of the [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/), which is the drone we are using in this course. As was mentioned in class, having a good characterization of these parameters is important for any controller derived from the system model to work well. We will estimate these parameters from data collected from a real Crazyflie in our lab as a warm up exercise for doing numerical computing in Python. The simple statistical tools we need will be explained as we go.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $\\omega_i$ is the rotational speed of the motor, $k_f$ is the thrust coefficient, and $k_m$ is the drag coefficient. The experimental procedure used to find $k_f$ is straightforward. Since $\\omega_i^2$ is linearly related to $F_i$ and $\\omega_i^2$ can be set to arbitrary values, we can simply measure the thrust produced at different values of $\\omega_i$ and perform a _linear regression_, which is another name for calculating the line of best fit.\n",

We have a data set $\\{(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\}_{i = 1}^N$, where $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ represents the input to some function and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ represents the measured output. We assume that the output is linearly related to the input and that there is some amount of additive random noise $e_i$ representing measurement error, i.e.\n",

Moreover, $\\mathbf{X}$ is rarely square and / or of full rank. We often choose $N >> n$ in order to compensate for the fact that some of our measurments will have significant errors. So, instead, we will try to find a value for $\\mathbf{a}$ that tries to get \"as close as possible\" to satisfying\n",
